# My AoC 2022 Code in Python

This was my first year trying to solve the [Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language.

I discovered about the website on a Discord channel on the 2023's early's and started to code the initial problems. I ended up liking the problems a lot. I found them to be so creative and some of them so challenging.

Doing a average of one AoC's day a day, I spent my last month learning and challenging myself doing the problems with vanilla Python, because:

- I realized that performance will not be an issue (AoC problemas has only one big input case to solve and there are no time constraints);

- it's my favorite language to solve quickly this type of code-interview-like problems;

- it's the language more used by AoC attendants.

At the end, I revisited a lot of concepts that I learned on my Algorithms and Data Structures classes, exercised OOP a lot and had a lot of fun. I thought I'd be looking at a lot more AoC forums and solutions, but I just checked them two or three times when I was struggling with the code and realized that I was on the right way.

In 2023, I expect to do the problems at the day they are released in a private leaderboard and to use a new programming language that I want to learn.
